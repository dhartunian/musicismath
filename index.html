    <p>Made more tweaks to the site and I think it's close to being ready for the web.</p>
    <p>It's crazy how many different blogging engines there are out there for someone like me to use. There's one in every single programming language for every framework and ones without frameworks and ones that are templating languages etc.</p>

    <p>Finally done with styling and coding up the basic front page of my
      website.</p>

    <p>The code is simple xhtml with css. Currently I'm just coding it by
      hand in plain html. Blogging engines have too much overhead and once I
      write enough to require one I'll move on from this.</p>
